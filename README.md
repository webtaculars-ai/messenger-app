# Messenger App

A basic Messenger App built with **React**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**. This app allows a user to select a friend from a list, send messages, and see the messages appear in the chat window.

## Features

- **Select a Friend**: The user can select a friend to chat with from a predefined list.
- **Send Messages**: The user can type and send messages to the selected friend.
- **Real-Time Chat Display**: Messages are instantly displayed in the chat window.
- **Clean UI**: Styled with Tailwind CSS for a responsive and modern design.

### Non-Goals

- No chat history persistence (messages are not saved between sessions).
- No backend integration (this is a frontend-only demo).
- No multiple user support (one user and one friend chat at a time).

## Technologies Used

- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **TypeScript**: Static typing to improve code reliability and maintainability.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling the UI.
- **Lucide-React**: For rendering icons in the UI.

## Installation

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
